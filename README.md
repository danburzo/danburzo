Hi, I'm Dan. I think about and build things for the web. Here are some highlights:

* [culori](https://github.com/Evercoder/culori), a JavaScript library for working with color. It has [its own website](https://culorijs.org);
* [percollate](https://github.com/danburzo/percollate), turn web pages into readable PDF, EPUB, or HTML files;
* [hred](https://github.com/danburzo/hred), reduce HTML to JSON with [qsx](https://github.com/danburzo/qsx), a query language based on CSS selectors.
* [vizor](https://llll.ro/tools/vizor) ([repo](https://github.com/llll-org/vizor)), a tiny front-end for OCR-ing text in images using the Google Vision API;
* [clipboard-inspector](https://github.com/Evercoder/clipboard-inspector), peek into your clipboard;
* [webcolors-cmyk](https://github.com/danburzo/webcolors-cmyk), CSS named colors converted to CMYK and back.
* [my toolbox](https://github.com/danburzo/toolbox);
