Hi, I'm Dan. I think about and build things for the web. Here are some highlights:

* [culori](https://github.com/Evercoder/culori), a JavaScript library for working with color. It has [its own website](https://culorijs.org);
* [percollate](https://github.com/danburzo/percollate), turn web pages into readable PDF, EPUB, or HTML files;
* [hred](https://github.com/danburzo/hred), reduce HTML to JSON with [qsx](https://github.com/danburzo/qsx), a query language based on CSS selectors.

Browser tools:

* [vizor](https://llll.ro/tools/vizor) ([repo](https://github.com/llll-org/vizor)), a tiny front-end for OCR-ing text in images using the Google Vision API;
* [clipboard-inspector](https://github.com/Evercoder/clipboard-inspector), peek into your clipboard;
* [input-methods](https://github.com/danburzo/input-methods), a reference & playground for DOM UI events and IMEs;
* [webcolors-cmyk](https://github.com/danburzo/webcolors-cmyk), CSS named colors converted to CMYK and back.

Resources:

* [my toolbox](https://github.com/danburzo/toolbox);
* miscellaneous [writing](https://github.com/danburzo/writing);
* [Watch Star Fork](https://github.com/danburzo/watchstarfork) (dedicated website coming someday);
* [corpora](https://github.com/danburzo/corpora), a bestiary of Romanian words;

The laundry list (on hiatus for the time being):

* notes on [working with React](https://github.com/danburzo/react-recipes);
* [marcel](https://github.com/marceljs), a static site generator and associated templating language;
* [uiuiui](https://github.com/Evercoder/uiuiui), UI components for React;
